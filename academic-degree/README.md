# Academic Degree

A dumb package to unfold degree abbreviations, mainly focused on USA ones.

Would this be of any use? Well, tbh I don't think so. Probably during college/graduate admission.

Install command:

```sh
espanso install academic-degree --git https://github.com/Vinfall/espanso-packages --external
```

Usage Example:
- Input: `:ms:`
- Output: `Master of Science`
